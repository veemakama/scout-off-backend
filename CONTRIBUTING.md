## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js — see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) for the exact version used by CI (currently Node 20)
  - If you use **nvm**: `nvm install && nvm use` (reads `.nvmrc` automatically)
  - If you use **fnm**: `fnm install && fnm use`
  - If you use **asdf**: `asdf install nodejs` (reads `.nvmrc` via the Node.js plugin)
- npm ≥ 9
- Git

> **`.nvmrc` is the single source of truth** for the Node.js version. CI workflows read it via `node-version-file: '.nvmrc'`, so bumping the version in that one file keeps local dev and CI in sync.

### Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scout-off/scout-off-backend.git
   cd scout-off-backend
   # Pick up the correct Node version automatically (nvm/fnm/asdf)
   nvm use   # or: fnm use
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-your-feature-description
   ```

3. **Pre-Contribution Checks**
   - All tests pass: `npm run test`
   - Linting passes: `npm run lint`
   - No security vulnerabilities: `npm audit`
   - Environment is set up: `cp .env.example .env`

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Claim an Issue

Comment on the GitHub issue to indicate you're working on it. Maintainers will assign it to you.

### 2. Make Changes and Test

```bash
npm run dev           # Start dev server with hot-reload
npm run test          # Run full test suite
npm run lint          # Check code style
npm audit             # Check for security vulnerabilities
```

### 3. Commit with Clear Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add player region filter

- Add region parameter to /api/players endpoint
- Update Soroban contract to support region queries
- Add integration tests for region filter

Fixes #123"
```

**Commit types:**
- `feat:` – New feature
- `fix:` – Bug fix
- `docs:` – Documentation only
- `chore:` – Dependency update, build config
- `refactor:` – Code restructuring
- `perf:` – Performance improvement
- `test:` – Test addition or fix
- `security:` – Security hardening

### 4. Push and Open a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin add-your-feature-description
```

Reference the issue in the PR description:
```

### 5. Review and Merge

- Respond to reviewer feedback in new commits (don't force-push)
- Ensure CI/CD checks pass
- Once approved, maintainers merge to `main`

## Code Quality Standards

### Required Checks

- **Tests**: New features must include unit or integration tests
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- **Linting**: No linting warnings
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Types**: Use strict TypeScript; avoid `any` types where possible

- **Documentation**: Update README if your changes affect user-facing behavior

- **Git History**: Use atomic commits with meaningful messages

### Coverage Goals

- Target ≥ 80% code coverage for new code
- Focus on critical paths: auth, payments, data validation
- See `tests/` directory for examples

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `camelCase.ts` for source, `camelCase.test.ts` for tests
- **Functions**: `camelCase()` for functions, `PascalCase` for classes/types
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for compile-time constants
- **Directories**: `lowercase` for module directories

## Security & Dependency Review

**All contributors must perform regular security audits.** This is a critical responsibility when working with blockchain payments and user data.

### Regular Dependency Audits

Run `npm audit` **before every commit** and **before every PR submission**:

```bash
npm audit
```

**Output interpretation:**
- ✅ **No vulnerabilities**: Safe to proceed
- ⚠️ **Low severity**: Document in PR; fix in next sprint if no workaround exists
- 🔴 **Moderate/High/Critical**: **Must fix before merging**
  - Moderate: Fix unless infeasible; document trade-offs
  - High/Critical: Fix immediately or block the PR

### Dependency Update Process

1. **Check for Updates**
   ```bash
   npm outdated
   ```

2. **Test Before Updating**
   ```bash
   npm update <package-name>
   npm run test && npm run lint && npm audit
   ```

3. **Review Breaking Changes**
   - Check the package's CHANGELOG
   - Test all affected code paths
   - Update types if needed

4. **Commit Dependency Updates**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "chore: update @stellar/stellar-sdk to 12.2.0

   - Update from 12.1.0 to 12.2.0
   - Fixes vulnerability in RPC error handling
   - All tests pass; no breaking changes

   Fixes #456"
   ```

### Critical Dependency Categories

The following dependencies require extra scrutiny during updates due to their security-sensitive roles:

| Package | Role | Why Critical |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `express` | Web framework | Handles auth, request validation, rate limiting |
| `@stellar/stellar-sdk` | Blockchain integration | Direct interaction with Stellar network, key material |
| `jsonwebtoken` | JWT handling | Authentication tokens, session management |
| `better-sqlite3` | Database | Stores user profiles, transaction records |
| `axios` / `node-fetch` | HTTP client | External API calls to Pinata/IPFS, Stellar Horizon |
| `dotenv` | Environment config | Loads sensitive secrets (JWT_SECRET, PINATA_KEY) |

**When updating these, always:**
- Run full test suite: `npm run test`
- Run security audit: `npm audit`
- Test integration points manually
- Verify no secrets are logged

### Supply Chain Security

- ✅ Use `npm ci` in CI/CD (reproducible installs)
- ✅ Lock `package-lock.json` in version control
- ✅ Audit transitive dependencies: `npm audit --depth=10`
- ✅ Review unknown publishers: `npm info <package> | grep -A5 contributors`
- ✅ Avoid deprecated packages in `npm audit`
- ❌ Do NOT use `npm install --force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` without justification

### Reviewing Deprecated Dependencies

When you encounter a deprecated package or see warnings during audit:

1. **Identify Deprecation Reason**
   ```bash
   npm info <package-name>
   ```
   Check for:
   - `deprecated` field (shows deprecation message)
   - No activity in past 12+ months
   - Known security vulnerabilities
   - Better alternatives available

2. **Evaluate Replacement Options**
   - Research recommended alternatives on npm
   - Check GitHub for active maintenance (recent commits, open issues)
   - Verify API compatibility with current usage
   - Consider migration effort vs. risk

3. **Migration Strategy**
   - Create a new issue to track the deprecation
   - Plan migration in a feature branch (e.g., `chore/replace-deprecated-package`)
   - Update one deprecated package at a time to isolate issues
   - Run full test suite after each replacement
   - Document any API changes in commit message

4. **Examples of Recently Handled Deprecations**
   | Old Package | Reason | Replacement | Status |
   |-------------|--------|-------------|--------|
   | `node-fetch@2` | Deprecated in favor of native fetch | native `fetch` or `axios` | Migration in progress |
   | Specific older packages | No longer maintained | Actively maintained fork | Queued for review |

5. **Security Review Checklist for Deprecated Packages**
   - [ ] Check CVE databases (NVD, Snyk, npm audit)
   - [ ] Review open security issues in GitHub
   - [ ] Verify no direct secrets/tokens in deprecation warnings
   - [ ] Document any interim workarounds
   - [ ] Set migration deadline (if package has known exploits)

### Reporting Security Issues

**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead:
1. Email maintainers privately
2. Include proof of concept (if safe to share)
3. Allow 7 days for maintainers to respond before public disclosure

## Filing Backend Issues

We track ~125 active issues. Use these guidelines to help us prioritize efficiently.

### Issue Categories

| `feature` | New capability or enhancement | Add region filter; support trial offer |
| `performance` | Optimization or speed improvements | Cache milestone queries; reduce latency |
| `documentation` | README, API docs, or code comments | Clarify error codes; add SDK examples |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior changes | Consolidate validation; reduce middleware |
| `infra` | Deployment, CI/CD, DevOps | GitHub Actions; database migration tools |
| `security` | Vulnerability fixes or hardening | JSON validation; rate limit on auth |
| `test` | Test coverage or reliability | Add contract edge cases; improve isolation |

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Severity | Timeline | Example |

| **P0** | Critical | Fix immediately | Contract init fails; data corruption |
| **P1** | High | Fix within sprint | Milestone broken; payment hangs |
| **P2** | Medium | Schedule next sprint | Scout search slow; stale validator list |
| **P3** | Low | Plan in backlog | Error message clarity; refactor unused module |

### How to File a High-Quality Issue

1. **Search Existing Issues First**  
   Avoid duplicates: https://github.com/scout-off/scout-off-backend/issues

2. **Use a Clear Title**  
   ✅ *"Auth token expires before subscription ends"*  
   ❌ *"Bug with tokens"*

3. **Provide Steps to Reproduce** (for bugs)
   ```
   1. Create a scout account
   2. Purchase a 30-day subscription via /api/scouts/subscribe
   3. Wait 25 days
   4. Call /api/scouts/:wallet/subscription
   
   Expected: subscription still active
   Actual: returns 401 NotSubscribed
   ```

4. **Include Environment Context**
   ```
   - OS: macOS 14.1 / Linux 24.04 / Windows 11
   - Node: v18.16.0
   - npm: 9.6.4
   - Key package versions: npm list express @stellar/stellar-sdk
   - Network: testnet / mainnet / local
   ```

5. **Add Labels**
   - Select category: `bug`, `feature`, `security`, etc.
   - Estimate priority: `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`
   - Maintainers will confirm priority

6. **Link Related Issues**
   ```
   Fixes #123
   Related to #456
   ```

### Issue Templates

Structured issue templates are available at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
When you click **New issue** on GitHub, choose the appropriate template
— **Bug report** for bugs, **Feature request** for new capabilities.
The templates prompt for the sections outlined above (repro steps,
environment, acceptance criteria, etc.) so issues arrive with
consistent detail.
