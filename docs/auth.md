# Authentication

This document describes the backend authentication flow for ScoutOff.
It covers SEP-10 challenge/response, JWT issuance, token claims, refresh behavior, logout, and example `curl` requests.

## SEP-10 Challenge / Response Flow

ScoutOff uses Stellar SEP-10 for wallet-based authentication.
The client proves ownership of a Stellar account by signing a server-issued challenge transaction.

### 1. Request a SEP-10 challenge

`GET /auth/challenge?account=G...`

Request a challenge XDR by passing the client Stellar account public key in the `account` query string.

Example:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/auth/challenge?account=GABC123..." \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

Successful response:

```json
{
  "challenge": "AAAA...",
  "networkPassphrase": "Test SDF Network"
}
```

- `challenge` is a SEP-10 transaction XDR that must be signed by the client wallet.
- `networkPassphrase` indicates which Stellar network the challenge uses.

### 2. Sign the challenge and request a JWT

`POST /auth/token`

After signing the challenge transaction, submit the signed XDR to the backend.
The request body should include the signed `transaction` and optionally a `role` hint when requesting a specific role such as `validator`.

Example:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/auth/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction": "AAAA...",
    "role": "scout"
  }'
```

Successful response:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "account": "GABC123...",
  "expiresAt": 1710000000
}
```

- `token` is the JWT used for authenticated API requests.
- `account` is the authenticated Stellar account.
- `expiresAt` is the UNIX timestamp when the token expires.

## JWT Claims Structure

The backend issues JWTs with the following standard claims:

- `sub`: the Stellar account that authenticated the request.
- `role`: the assigned role for the token.
- `exp`: token expiration timestamp.

Example decoded payload:

```json
{
  "sub": "GABC123...",
  "role": "player",
  "iat": 1700000000,
  "exp": 1700086400
}
```

### Supported roles

The backend supports these token roles:

- `player`
- `scout`
- `validator`
- `admin`

The `role` may be assigned from the request or automatically elevated to `admin` if the authenticated account matches the configured `ADMIN_WALLET`.

## Token Refresh

There is no separate refresh endpoint.
A new JWT is obtained by repeating the SEP-10 flow:
request a challenge, sign it, and call `POST /auth/token` again.

### Example refresh flow

1. `GET /auth/challenge?account=GABC123...`
2. Sign the returned challenge transaction
3. `POST /auth/token` with the signed transaction

The backend issues a new JWT each time, and the returned `expiresAt` indicates the next expiration.

## Logout

The backend does not expose a dedicated logout endpoint.
Logout is handled on the client side by discarding the stored JWT.
After logout, do not send the token in `Authorization` headers anymore.

If the token expires, the backend will reject protected requests with `401 Invalid or expired token`.

## Using the JWT for authenticated API requests

Protected endpoints require the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Example request to a protected route:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

## Auth-related endpoints

### `GET /auth/challenge?account=G...`

- Purpose: request a SEP-10 challenge transaction for the given Stellar account.
- Authentication: none.
- Returns: challenge XDR and network passphrase.

### `POST /auth/token`

- Purpose: submit the signed SEP-10 challenge and receive a JWT.
- Authentication: none.
- Request body:
  - `transaction` (string): signed challenge XDR
  - `role` (optional string): requested role hint
- Returns: JWT, authenticated account, and expiration timestamp.

### `POST /api/admin/introspect`

This admin route can be used to verify a token and inspect its payload.
It requires a valid admin JWT and is useful for debugging.

Example:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/introspect" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "token": "<token-to-inspect>" }'
```

Successful response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "sub": "GABC123...",
    "role": "admin",
    "iat": 1700000000,
    "exp": 1700086400
  }
}
```
