# ScoutOff

[![Soroban Contract CI](https://github.com/your-org/scout-off/actions/workflows/contract-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-org/scout-off/actions/workflows/contract-ci.yml)

Decentralized football scouting platform on Stellar — tamper-proof player profiles, on-chain progress verification, and direct scout-to-player connections powered by Soroban smart contracts.

## Overview

ScoutOff solves the visibility problem for talented footballers in underserved regions. Players build dynamic on-chain profiles backed by verified milestones — confirmed by coaches, academy directors, and certified trainers — giving scouts the confidence to act on what they see.

Stellar is the backbone: sub-cent transaction fees mean a scout in Europe can pay to contact a player in South America or Africa without hefty banking overhead, transactions settle in 3–5 seconds for a smooth mobile experience, and Soroban smart contracts make every progress update tamper-proof and auditable.

## Features

- **Dynamic Player Profiles**: On-chain identity linked to off-chain vitals, highlight reels (IPFS/Arweave), and verified stats
- **Verifiable Progress Bar**: Milestones confirmed by approved validators are written to the blockchain — no faking a progress level
- **Tiered Verification**: Four levels from unverified profile through elite tier, each requiring real-world confirmation
- **Scout Discovery**: Filter players by region, position, and verified progress tier
- **Pay-to-Contact**: Scouts pay micro-fees in XLM or a platform token to unlock premium data or initiate contact
- **Subscription Model**: Scouts can hold an active subscription for unlimited browsing within a tier
- **SEP-10 Auth**: Players and scouts log in securely with a Stellar wallet (Freighter, Albedo, or Lobstr)
- **Decentralized Storage**: Highlight reels and photos stored on IPFS; content hashes saved on-chain in the player's profile

### Core Components

- **register.rs**: Handles player profile creation, stores IPFS content hashes, assigns initial verification level
- **progress.rs**: Validates milestone submissions from approved validators and increments a player's progress tier
- **subscription.rs**: Manages scout subscriptions and pay-to-contact payments in XLM or platform token
- **connection.rs**: Records secure contact agreements between scouts and players on-chain
- **storage.rs**: Persistent storage for player metadata, validator registry, and scout access records
- **events.rs**: Event emission for off-chain indexing (new profiles, milestone updates, scout contacts)

### Progress Tier Model

Tiers are gated by real-world verification and enforced on-chain:

| Level | Name                  | Requirement                                                  |
|-------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Unverified            | Player creates profile and uploads data                      |
| 1     | Verified Identity     | KYC passed or academy confirms active club membership        |
| 2     | Performance Milestones| Match footage or physical stats verified by approved third party |
| 3     | Elite Tier            | Scout feedback or trial offer logged on-chain                |

Example: A validator submits "Scored 5 goals in Local Cup" → Soroban contract writes the milestone → player's progress bar updates → scouts see a tamper-proof history of when and how the player progressed.

### Valid Transitions

| From    | To      | Trigger                                                        |
|---------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 0 | Level 1 | Academy or KYC provider calls `approve_milestone` (identity)  |
| Level 1 | Level 2 | Approved validator submits and approves performance milestone  |
| Level 2 | Level 3 | Scout calls `log_trial_offer` — offer recorded on-chain       |

## Security Features

1. **Tamper-Proof History**: Every milestone is a blockchain transaction — scouts see exactly when and how a player progressed
2. **Validator Registry**: Only admin-approved validators can confirm milestones, preventing self-reporting abuse
3. **Atomic Payments**: Scout contact fees and subscription payments settle in a single transaction
4. **Authorization Checks**: All state-changing operations require proper Stellar account authorization
5. **Immutable Milestone Records**: Approved milestones cannot be altered or deleted post-confirmation
6. **Circuit Breaker**: Admin can pause the contract in an emergency without losing state

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build Smart Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
stellar contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/scout_off.wasm
```

### 3. Deploy to Testnet

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/scout_off.optimized.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

### 4. Initialize Contract

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --token <XLM_OR_TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  --platform_fee_bps 500
```

### 5. Run the Backend

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in CONTRACT_ID, JWT_SECRET, HORIZON_URL, SOROBAN_RPC_URL, PINATA_API_KEY, etc.
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Available npm scripts:**

| Script | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | `ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/index.ts` | Start with hot-reload for development |
| `npm run build` | `tsc` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` |
| `npm start` | `node dist/index.js` | Run the compiled server (run `build` first) |
| `npm test` | `jest --runInBand` | Run the test suite |
| `npm run lint` | `eslint 'src/**/*.ts' 'tests/**/*.ts' --ext .ts` | Run TypeScript linting |

On startup the server will:
- Open (or create) a SQLite database at `DB_PATH` (default: `scout-off.db`)
- Begin polling Soroban for contract events every 5 seconds
- Fail fast if `CONTRACT_ID` or `JWT_SECRET` are missing

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions.

## How It Works

1. **Player Onboarding**
   - Connect Freighter wallet (SEP-10 auth)
   - Fill out profile: position, region, age, club
   - Upload highlight reels → stored on IPFS via Pinata
   - Call `register_player` — profile minted on Stellar ledger at Level 0

2. **Milestone Verification**
   - Coach or academy director submits a milestone (e.g., "Top speed 32 km/h")
   - Approved validator calls `approve_milestone` on-chain
   - Player's progress tier increments — visible immediately on scout dashboard

3. **Scout Discovery**
   - Scout subscribes or pays per contact in XLM
   - Filters players by region, position, and minimum verified tier
   - Views tamper-proof milestone history before deciding to reach out
   - Calls `pay_to_contact` — micro-fee settles in seconds, contact details unlocked

4. **Trial Offer Logging**
   - Scout submits a trial offer via `log_trial_offer`
   - Contract records the offer on-chain, advancing player to Elite Tier (Level 3)
   - Both parties have an immutable record of the agreement

5. **Admin / Validator Management**
   - Admin registers trusted validators (coaches, academies, certified trainers)
   - Admin monitors platform fees and calls `withdraw_fees` to collect revenue
   - Emergency `pause_contract` available as a circuit breaker

## Testing

```bash
# Smart contract tests
cd contracts && cargo test

# Backend tests
npm run test
```

Contract test coverage includes:
- ✅ Player registration and metadata storage
- ✅ Milestone submission and approval by validators
- ✅ Progress tier increments and tamper-proof history
- ✅ Scout subscription and pay-to-contact payments
- ✅ Trial offer logging and Elite Tier promotion
- ✅ Validator registry — add and revoke
- ✅ Authorization enforcement on all state-changing calls
- ✅ Pause / unpause circuit breaker
- ✅ Edge cases: duplicate milestones, unauthorized validators, zero-fee configs

## MVP Scope

The initial testnet MVP focuses on a single end-to-end flow:

1. One player registers a profile and uploads a highlight reel → IPFS hash stored on-chain
2. One validator approves a milestone → player progress increments to Level 2
3. One scout pays a micro-fee → contact details unlocked

Everything else (subscriptions, trial offer logging, fractionalized sponsorship) ships in subsequent milestones.

## Roadmap

- [x] Player profile registration on Stellar testnet
- [x] Validator-approved milestone system
- [ ] Scout discovery filters (region, position, tier)
- [ ] Pay-to-contact micro-fee flow
- [ ] Scout subscription model
- [ ] Trial offer logging (Elite Tier promotion)
- [ ] Mobile frontend (Flutter)
- [ ] Fractionalized player sponsorship via Player Tokens
- [ ] Mainnet launch

## Why Stellar

- **Microtransactions**: Scouts pay fractions of a cent to unlock data or contact players — no banking fees across borders
- **Speed**: Transactions settle in 3–5 seconds, critical for players on low-end mobile devices
- **Future Expansion**: Fractionalized sponsorship — fans buy "Player Tokens" to fund a young player's training; if the player turns professional, a percentage of their transfer fee routes back to token holders via Soroban
